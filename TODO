svg size? ***see resizeD3.html, viewBox attribute for svg

what about making the bookmarklet....
  go to pfr.com
  read the rows into the array.
  toggle off the entire visual display
  add a new svg element that is the size of the browser viewport
  display the d3 chart in that svg, it should scale?
  attach browser resize event, resize the svg accordingly.
